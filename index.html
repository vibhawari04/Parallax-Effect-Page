          Adventures don’t have to be dangerous. You don’t have to fear for your
          life. You don’t have to go shark-diving or sail around the world solo.
          Adventure is all about attitude. Trying something new, or trying
          something differently than before. Getting out of your comfort zone.
          Willfully choosing to walk an unknown path. Adventure requires a
          certain amount of bravery. Daring to step into that new restaurant in
          your hometown where you can’t pronounce the items on the menu.
          Choosing to take the local form of transportation instead of hiring a
          car. Booking a spontaneous holiday to a new destination with a new
          travel companion.ADVENTURE LOOKS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE Not everyone
          can/wants to/is able to travel. Not everyone wants to feel their heart
          pounding in their throat as they peer over a tall waterfall, ready to
          jump.
          <br /><br />
          And you know what? THAT’S OKAY! Adventure is never far away. In your
          home state. Country. Even your current home town. You can have
          adventures every day without risking your life, spending away your
          life savings, or having to fly halfway across the world. My mission
          with Adventure is Never Far Away is to not only help you understand
          what an adventure actually is, but: To teach and inspire you to have
          adventures in your everyday life. To give you a sense of fulfillment
          and memories to last a lifetime. To encourage you to try new things.
          To learn how to get exposed to new ideas and thoughts. To offer ways
          to break up your day-to-day routine. To show you how to build your own
          adventure, no matter where you are in life or in the world. To prove
          that ANYONE can have an adventurous life. To demonstrate, through
          stories and experiences, that having adventures adds color and flavor
          to your existence. And finally, to illustrate how you cultivate the
          types of adventures that YOU want to have – not the ones that society
          feels you need to experience. Doing things based on your own
          preferences. Discovering what excites you the most and drives you to
          be a better person.

          <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Bicycle aficionado or not, you’ve probably encountered the terms
          ‘biking’ and ‘cycling’ many times. Biking and cycling normally
          involves the same thing – a bicycle. If these two words supposedly
          have interchangeable meanings, then why do some people prefer to use
          one over the other? In this article, we break down the differences and
          put iron out the confusion once and for all! Cycling professionals
          usually use both of these words depending on the context. Cyclists and
          bikers can both ride bicycles, but what about other cycle types like
          unicycles and tricycles? Before we talk about the different ways these
          two words are used, let us first take a brief look at the history of
          the bicycle. A bicycle is a two-wheeled vehicle that has a seat and a
          steering handle. It can be moved by propelling your feet on the
          pedals. Also called a bike, pushbike, a cycle or a velocipede – this
          popular mode of transportation owes its invention to a number of
          people. The earliest bicycle was introduced in the 19th century, and
          the original design stayed almost the same as the modern bicycle we
          know now. The earliest predecessor of the bicycle was a contraption
          made in the early 1410 invention of a man named Giovanni Fontana. It
          had four wheels and some ropes and gears that held them together. In
          the course of the bicycle’s development, there had been several
          inventors and innovators who contributed to what we know today as the
          modern bicycle.
          <br /><br />
          WHAT IS BIKING? Biking is an activity that involves a bicycle. You can
          ride the bike on a road, bike path, a mountain trail, or rough
          terrain. Some use the term “biking” to refer specifically to a
          mountain biking context, and it is often associated with riding a
          heavy duty bicycle on rougher terrain. Mountain biking usually takes
          place on mountain trails, dirt roads, or parks. It first originated as
          a sport in California, United States. The first bikers who engaged in
          the sport used a type of bike called cruiser bicycles. This
          single-speed bicycle comes with balloon tyres and an upright seating
          posture. It has fewer gears, which make it the perfect bike when you
          want to simply enjoy riding without thinking about what gears to
          control. Nowadays, people who engage in mountain biking and
          off-the-road biking use mountain bikes.

          <h2 class="description">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by
          people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the
          slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible
          than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off
          or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air
          sport in the world.
          <br />
          First you have to take the parachute to the hill where you will make
          your jump. Be aware that the weight of parachute can vary between 6-15
          kg. When you climb up the hill, all you need is a paragliding wing. As
          the paragliding pilot, you should be careful to make sure that the
          field is not obstructed by anything such as trees or structures. The
          paragliding pilot should run down the hill, and there is no need to
          run too fast because the wind will help enough already. The type of
          sports parachute used in paragliding is designed for easier take off
          and landing. It is always a better choice to learn from someone
          prevalent in the sports. And thanks to the paragliding courses in
          various places, you can easily bring this extreme sport to your life.

        <p class="text">
          Surfing involves standing on a specially designed surf board and
          riding a breaking wave. There’s nothing quite like the experience of
          catching one of nature’s forces, the breaking wave. You are able to
          harness that power to speed you along the wave and perform a variety
          of manoeuvres. ASI provides the skills, knowledge and framework to
          help you develop your surfing skills, pursue a career as an outdoor
          recreation instructor or sports coach, or become a professional
          competition surfer. ASI can help you get there !

          surfing with the pull of the wind power provided by the kite.
